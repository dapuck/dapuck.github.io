Back in January I signed up to two different robo advisors, so I could compare them and see which one worked better for me and if they did better than my traditional brokerage account. If you are not familiar with the concept of a robo advisor they are brokerages where, instead of picking stocks and funds yourself or with the help of a financial advisor, you select a level of risk and an algorithm selects a set of financial assets for you. The algorithm can also automatically re-balance your portfolio and do "tax loss harvesting" for you (I'll explain that latter).

I singed up for both on the same day (January 15th) and funded both of them with $1000. I did not add any more to the investment accounts over the 6 months. No one time or automatic deposits. Here is how it went.

# Sign-up #
Sign-up for both was easy and simple. Just some biographic / due diligence questions and the account is created! Where they start to differ is in how they suggest what general investment portfolio you should go with.

SoFi only asked for my age before making a suggestion. Wealthfront asked several more questions about my risk tolerance before making a suggestion. The Wealthfront process left me feeling more confident in the suggestion, but in both cases I ended up with their most aggressive portfolio allocations.

# Funding #
Funding the accounts is another area where they were similar, but not the same. In both cases you need to add an external savings or checking account. They both also use a system (which looks to be provided by the same vendor) where you select you bank from a menu and provide your login details. The system then connects to your bank's website and scrapes the account details. This seemed a little sketchy to me, but it also looks like this the the direction several fin-tech companies are going. Fortunately for me, my bank was not on their list, so I entered my ACH details manually. 

The first difference here was that it was much easier to find the button to manually add an account on SoFi than on Wealthfront. Wealthfront also required verifying the account using small test transactions. This lead to a delay in funding my Wealthfront account. So while I setup both transfers on the same day (Jan. 15), it took a whole extra day for Wealthfront to receive the money and start investing putting it a day behind.

# Features #
Before discussing the results there are some differences between the two that I should point out. First is that SoFi's investment mix includes funds managed by SoFi. It's up to you to decide if you are comfortable with this kind of "self dealing".

And second is that Wealthfront supports automatic "tax loss harvesting" and SoFi does not (I told you I would come back to that). Tax loss harvesting is way to reduce tax burden by selling an asset at a loss and then buying a different asset that is similar (but not substantially similar) to the one that was sold. It's important that they are not "substantially similar" so as not to trigger what the IRS calls a "wash sale", which would prevent you from claiming the loss when you do your taxes. So if you sold shares of an S&P 500 ETF at a loss and turned around and bought an S&P 500 mutual fund you would "harvest" a loss that can be claimed at tax time. The idea is that you can offset future gains by locking in today's losses, but still maintain the same market exposure in your portfolio.
