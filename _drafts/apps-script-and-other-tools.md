If you are like me, you have a lot to do in any given day. Some big, complicated things, like designing a new server architecture or crafting a complex and efficient SQL query. But there are also a lot of little things, like sorting and deleting email or keeping track of your Github issues.

As a coder, I could write custom scripts to automate most things. Most of these things, like my email and Github, have APIs that I can look up. Then I just need to write a script, put it somewhere that it can run with the needed permissions, and then put it on a cron or find some other way for it to be triggered. And you can't forget about having a way to authenticate with the service, making sure that any tokens or keys that you need stay secure, along with many other security concerns.

But I'm lazy! I don't want to write a ton of code to delete old emails or create reminders. And I just want to solve my problem, not a bunch of problems around my problem. Fortunately there are tools out there that can help. Two that I have used are IFTTT, and Google Apps Script.
