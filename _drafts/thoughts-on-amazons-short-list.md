On January 18, 2018, Amazon announced that they had narrowed down the list of contenders for the company's second headquarters (dubbed HQ2) to just 20. They are, in alphabetical order:

 * Atlanta
 * Austin
 * Boston
 * Chicago
 * Columbus
 * Dallas
 * Denver
 * Indianapolis
 * Los Angeles
 * Miami
 * Montgomery County, MD
 * Nashville
 * Newark
 * New York City
 * Northern Virginia
 * Philadelphia
 * Pittsburgh
 * Raleigh
 * Toronto
 * Washington D.C.

As many articles and blogs have pointed out, most of the cities on the list are not a surprise. There are a few smaller cities that not many were considering, and one or two notable omissions (_ahem Detroit_).

As someone who works in one of the lovely metros listed above, I of course have some opinions on the competition and why Chicago is the best choice. But first, let's thin the herd.

## Columbus, Indianapolis, Nashville, Raleigh
Right off the bat we can remove Columbus, Indianapolis, Nashville, and Raleigh from the list. They are all fine cities, but they aren't exactly tech hubs or hubs in the making. You would also have a hard time getting talent from across the country to move to any of these cities (I'm not going to).

And then there were 16. But there are still more we can rule out.

## Miami
Like the 4 that we have already eliminated, Miami is not exactly a tech hub. It is however a place you could get people to move to (not me though). But hurricanes and rising sea levels threatening to swallow up your nice new headquarters (along with the rest of the city and state) make Miami a poor choice.

## Los Angeles
As the only city on the list from the west coast, it's bid is also doomed. LA has more of a tech scene than some of the other cities, but it's too close to Silicon Valley and doesn't have anything to pull talent away from there. And having been there, I can't recommend it.

## Newark
Let's be honest, the only thing Newark has going for it is a pile of cash. Contrary to what some people say, companies don't make massive decisions based on "incentive" packages. They are probably only on the list to get other cities to offer more money.

## New York City

## Atlanta

## Austin, Dallas

## Philadelphia, Pittsburgh

## Boston

## Montgomery County, Northern Virginia, Washington D.C.

## Denver

## Toronto

## Chicago
