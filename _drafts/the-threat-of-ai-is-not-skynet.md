title: "The threat of AI is not Skynet"

Several tech luminaries have come out with fears that "AI" may herald the end of humanity. The common theme is that when the machines become intelligent, they will view us piles of meat as redundant, anachronistic, and a waste of resources. To bolster their arguments, they call upon the dystopian sci-fi story lines made common knowledge thanks to block buster movies.

Personally, I don't find the arguments made by these thinkers very compelling. The real threat of AI is not "Skynet" or "The Matrix", it's mass unemployment. I believe that before we can achieve a level of AI that may be be considered "human like" or even sentient, machine learning (the under pinning of AI) will be used to automate entire classes of human labor.

## AI Is On The Road

The first class of human labor that will completely taken over by machines will be driving. Unless you have been living under a rock on one of the moons of Jupiter, you have probably heard of Google's self driving car and Tesla's auto pilot. You may have even heard about Uber testing self driving cars in Philly. But passenger vehicles will not be the beach head of the machines. No, they are targeting much larger pray, the big rigs.

Unless you voraciously follow news from AI researchers and/or the under reported press releases from auto manufactures industrial equipment divisions, you may have missed some of the demonstrations of how far machine learning as come in the aid of getting goods from point A to point B. Mercedes-Benz, DaimlerChrysler have both demonstrated (on a closed track) their existing models retro fitted to drive on their own (one startup developed the technology used in both demos). A convoy of automated rigs have also "platooned" across Europe.

You can bet that every manufacturer of tractor trailers, that expects to be around in the next 5-10 years, are working on producing self driving models. Since a self driving truck can be on the road longer and drive in a more fuel efficient way, any and all trucking companies will want to replace or retrofit their fleets.

## AI Doesn't Create Jobs

But what happens to the 3.5 million truck drivers in the US alone? Sure, not all of them will loose their jobs. But many of the best paying jobs in the field with be done by an AI. AI will take millions of jobs off the market. It's unlikely that these jobs will be replaced, in net, with other jobs. Proponents of such automation will claim that the jobs it will create cannot be imagined yet, but that kind of blind faith is not confidence inspiring.

## Not Everyone is Going to be A _____

But that still leaves millions of truck drivers that cannot find work as truck drivers. The political solution is "retraining", turning blue collar workers into white collar. While using code camps to turn truck drivers into coders gets great press, but it is unrealistic to expect even a majority of blue collar workers to make this leap. Not everyone is going to be a coder, accountant, or CNC operator. And many that find work will not be making nearly as much as they used to.

We also have to consider what happens when the jobs we are training displaced workers for are eventually taken over by AI and automation as well. Do we just retrain them again for another job that will disappear? Some would argue that they should move into jobs that are "automation proof", but the only jobs that could be argued to be automation proof would be artistic/creative jobs.

Training people to become artists is difficult. And such a program still suffers from the same issues as other retraining programs. Not everyone is going to become a YouTuber, written, or artist. And most that do will not make much money. A few may rise to the level of a Casey Neistat or John Green, most will struggle to make ends meet.
