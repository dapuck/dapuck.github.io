Stress. We all want to avoid stress. Stress causes deformation, degradation. Over time, stress breaks and destroys.

Pressure is a force. It pushes. It can push forward, or back. It can push down, up, in, or out. Pressure can cause stress, but you need it in order to do work. 

So while we all want to, and should, reduce our stress, you still need to keep up the pressure in order to get things done.
