This is my second batch of wine, and I think I have learned from some of my mistakes. This was done using the same ingredients as my first batch of wine. This time I started late on a Friday so the first fermentation late in the day on Sunday. Also since I used somewhat less than half the packet of yeast on the first batch, this one got a little more yeast.

I have also now started taking temperatures along with the gravity readings. Since the hydrometer I use is calibrated to 60&deg;F, taking the temperature of the liquid at the time of measurement allows me to correct the reading. This usually only results in a difference of a 0.001-0.003, but that can be enough to change the estimated and calculated ABV.

The improved measurement tools and the "bonus" yeast combined likely account for the higher estimated ABV and calculated ABV after the primary fermentation.
