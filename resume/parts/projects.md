Personal Projects
=================

I always have a number of on going programing projects that are primarily for my own personal use and enrichment. You can find the code for most of these projects on my GitHub profile page (https://github.com/ianmcodes). I also have some modules in the npm registry, you can find a list on my profile (https://www.npmjs.org/~dapuck). Other interests include Arduino, Raspberry Pi, electronics design, 3D Printing, and woodworking.

Some of my more widely used projects are:

[node-simple-spinner](https://github.com/ianmcodes/node-simple-spinner)

Just as the name implies, this is a simple "spinner" animation for command line node applications. It has start and stop functions, and lets you customize the animation.

[node-svn-interface](https://github.com/ianmcodes/node-svn-interface)

This is a Node.js module that interacts with SVN by spawn and the console svn command. I created this module to use with the some deployment scripts that I wrote as Manager of Technical operations at Brandify.
