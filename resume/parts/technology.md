Technology
==========

In addition to the experience that I have gained through work and earning my degree, I have also worked on a variety of personal projects in my free time. I have installed and used several Linux distributions, including Ubuntu, Red Hat, and Gentoo. On all of these systems I have installed and configured MySQL and Apache. I have worked with Amazon's cloud platforms, especially S3, RDS, and EC2. I also have a few projects that use Arduino and RaspberryPi.

### Personal Projects

I always have a number of on going programing projects that are primarily for my own personal use and enrichment. You can find the code for most of these projects on my GitHub profile page (https://github.com/dapuck). My most active projects on GitHub use Node.js. I find coding for Node.js very enjoyable, especially given my experience with JavaScript. I even have some modules in the npm registry, you can find a list on my profile (https://www.npmjs.org/~dapuck).

Some of the projects I am actively working on are:

[node-svn-interface](https://github.com/dapuck/node-svn-interface)

{% endunless %}

My most popular project. It is a Node.js module that interacts with SVN by spawn and the console svn command. I created this module to use with the some deployment scripts that I wrote as Manager of Technical operations at Where2GetIt.

[node-mac-vhid](https://github.com/dapuck/node-mac-vhid)

[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/mac-vhid.png?downloads=true&downloadRank=true&stars=true)](https://nodei.co/npm/mac-vhid/)
{% endunless %}

My first Node.js addon, written in C++. It provides an interface to allow you to simulate mouse and keyboard actions through Node on a Mac.

[node-simple-spinner](https://github.com/dapuck/node-simple-spinner)

[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/simple-spinner.png?downloads=true&downloadRank=true&stars=true)](https://nodei.co/npm/simple-spinner/)
{% endunless %}

Just as the name implies, this is a simple "spinner" animation for command line node applications. It has start and stop functions, and even lets you customize the animation.
