As a Developer at Where 2 Get It, I work on bug fixes and new features for our front-end systems written in JavaScript and HTML, our Perl back-end, and our PostgreSQL database. I have also written custom JavaScript code to meet client requirements, as well as putting together development time estimates for client requests.

Part of my duties as Manager of Technical Operations included integrating code written by our core group of developers as well as contract developers, and deploying code to our Staging and Production environments. I also worked with a contractor on creating a set of Selenium tests that are used for automated QA. As part of that, I created an enhanced wrapper around the test that we were using. I currently maintain it as an Open Source project called [sei-improved](https://www.npmjs.org/package/sei-improved).

Now as Development Manager, I take a more direct role in managing the team. I need to make sure that everyone has work to do, and knows what the expectations are. I also work on requirements and design documents for new features and changes to our architecture.

Some of my more notable accomplishments at Where 2 Get It have been the creation of a set of JavaScript libraries for the mobile locator, creating a contract building system, a dynamic photo gallery generator, and a set of scripts to automate code deployment. I have also worked on, and continue to work on, integrating several Google products into Where2GetIt's architecture. These would include Google Maps and Geocoder, Google Drive, and Google Map Engine. The integration with Google Map Engine (GME) also involved using Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) and Simple Queue Service (SQS).

### Model Metrics, Chicago, IL
#### Developer (May 2010 - August 2010)

Model Metrics was a provider cloud computing solutions using salesforce.com, Amazon, and Google. Most recently Model Metrics has been acquired by salesforce.com.

During my time at Model Metrics I primarily used the ETL (Extract Transform Load) tool, Talend, to do complex data migrations and integrations for clients. I also worked on enhancements to internal tools, written in PHP, that analyzed the quality of clients' data in salesforce.com. One of those enhancements was to improve report generation speed by developing a way to generate the pages of the report in parallel.
