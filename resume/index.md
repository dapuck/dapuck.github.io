Work Experience
---------------

### Where2GetIt, Des Plaines, IL
#### Development Manager (April 2014 - Present)
#### Manager of Technical Operations (December 2012 - April 2014)
#### Front-End Developer (March 2011 - Present)

Where 2 Get It is a location based marketing services company based in Anaheim, CA. The company offers local search solution for national brands, such as Chick-fil-a, Patagonia, and Disney Stores. Their solutions include desktop and mobile store locators, data syndication and claiming for Google, InfoUSA, Navteq, and others, location pages for individual stores/dealers, and more.
For more information on Where 2 Get It, see their website. [www.where2getit.com](http://www.where2getit.com)

As a Developer at Where 2 Get It, I work on bug fixes and new features for our front-end systems written in JavaScript and HTML, our Perl back-end, and our PostgreSQL database. I have also written custom JavaScript code to meet client requirements, as well as putting together development time estimates for client requests.

Part of my duties as Manager of Technical Operations included integrating code written by our core group of developers as well as contract developers, and deploying code to our Staging and Production environments. I also worked with a contractor on creating a set of Selenium tests that are used for automated QA. As part of that, I created an enhanced wrapper around the test that we were using. I currently maintain it as an Open Source project called [sei-improved](https://www.npmjs.org/package/sei-improved).

Now as Development Manager, I take a more direct role in managing the team. I need to make sure that everyone has work to do, and knows what the expectations are. I also work on requirements and design documents for new features and changes to our architecture.

Some of my more notable accomplishments at Where 2 Get It have been the creation of a set of JavaScript libraries for the mobile locator, creating a contract building system, a dynamic photo gallery generator, and a set of scripts to automate code deployment. I have also worked on, and continue to work on, integrating several Google products into Where2GetIt's architecture. These would include Google Maps and Geocoder, Google Drive, and Google Map Engine. The integration with Google Map Engine (GME) also involved using Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) and Simple Queue Service (SQS).

### Model Metrics, Chicago, IL
#### Developer (May 2010 - August 2010)

Model Metrics was a provider cloud computing solutions using salesforce.com, Amazon, and Google. Most recently Model Metrics has been acquired by salesforce.com.

During my time at Model Metrics I primarily used the ETL (Extract Transform Load) tool, Talend, to do complex data migrations and integrations for clients. I also worked on enhancements to internal tools, written in PHP, that analyzed the quality of clients' data in salesforce.com. One of those enhancements was to improve report generation speed by developing a way to generate the pages of the report in parallel.

### Center for the Studies of Ethics in the Professions (CSEP), Chicago, IL
#### Student Worker

The Center for the Studies of Ethics in the Professions (CSEP), at the Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT), promotes research and teaching on practical moral problems in the professions. It is the first interdisciplinary center for ethics to focus on the professions. The CSEP continues to do interdisciplinary research, assist professional societies in creating and updating codes of ethics, and they also conduct ethics workshops. They also provide a number of resources for ethics research, such as their Codes of Ethics Online Collection. For more information about the CSEP see their website. [ethics.iit.edu](http://ethics.iit.edu)

I worked for the CSEP for a total of 3 years while attending IIT, as part of the federal work study program. In addition to general office work, I helped maintain the Codes of Ethics Online Collection, I wrote Perl scripts to automate site template changes, and I provided user level computer support and trouble shooting.

Technology
----------

In addition to the experience that I have gained through work and earning my degree, I have also worked on a variety of personal projects in my free time. I have installed and used several Linux distributions, including Ubuntu, Red Hat, and Gentoo. On all of these systems I have installed and configured MySQL and Apache. I have worked with Amazon's cloud platforms, especially S3, RDS, and EC2. I also have a few projects that use Arduino and RaspberryPi.

### Personal Projects

I always have a number of on going programing projects that are primarily for my own personal use and enrichment. You can find the code for most of these projects on my GitHub profile page (https://github.com/dapuck). My most active projects on GitHub use Node.js. I find coding for Node.js very enjoyable, especially given my experience with JavaScript. I even have some modules in the npm registry, you can find a list on my profile (https://www.npmjs.org/~dapuck).

Some of the projects I am actively working on are:

* [node-svn-interface](https://github.com/dapuck/node-svn-interface)

[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/svn-interface.png?downloads=true&downloadRank=true&stars=true)](https://nodei.co/npm/svn-interface/)

My most popular project. It is a Node.js module that interacts with SVN by spawn and the console svn command. I created this module to use with the some deployment scripts that I wrote as Manager of Technical operations at Where2GetIt.

* [node-mac-vhid](https://github.com/dapuck/node-mac-vhid)

[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/mac-vhid.png?downloads=true&downloadRank=true&stars=true)](https://nodei.co/npm/mac-vhid/)

My first Node.js addon, written in C++. It provides an interface to allow you to simulate mouse and keyboard actions through Node on a Mac.

* [node-simple-spinner](https://github.com/dapuck/node-simple-spinner)

[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/simple-spinner.png?downloads=true&downloadRank=true&stars=true)](https://nodei.co/npm/simple-spinner/)

Just as the name implies, this is a simple "spinner" animation for command line node applications. It has start and stop functions, and even lets you customize the animation.

* [Lobby-Cast](https://github.com/dapuck/loby-cast)

My first Chromecast app. It has a browser based sender (which can be found [here](http://www.ianmccall.codes/lobby-cast/)) and a Custom receiver. It is all built using HTML and JavaScript.
