      <h1>This is something about me?</h1>
      <p>
        Why yes, yes it is.

        As you can likely guess, my name is Ian McCall. I live and work in the <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/e1U9W">Chicago</a> area. I currently work as a web developer for a company called <a href="http://www.where2getit.com/">Where 2 Get It</a>, though my official title is "Development Manager". For work I mostly use JavaScript (both Node.js and browser) and Perl. Among other things, I work a lot on the different integrations with Google. Mostly the Google Maps API but more recently I have been working with Google Maps Engine (GME).

        While I am experienced in many languages (Ruby, Python, Perl, Java, etc...), my language of choice is JavaScript. I really do have more fun coding in JavaScript than in any other language. And now, with the rise of Node.js, JavaScript has a legitimacy and respectability that it hasn't had before. My favorite parts about JavaScript also tend to be the things people complain about most. Like how it is inherently asynchronous and the way it treats value types.
