As you can likely guess, my name is Ian McCall, and I live and work in the [Chicago](https://goo.gl/maps/e1U9W) area. I am currently a Sr. Software Engineer for [Tribune Publishing](https://www.tribpub.com/).

I used to work for a company called [Brandify](http://www.brandify.com/). I started there as a Front-end Developer and in the end I left as Development Manager. I mostly used JavaScript (both Node.js and browser) and Perl. I worked on a lot of different integrations with Google APIs (mostly the Google Maps API) and other APIs. I worked with Storm and Kafka at Brandify as well.
